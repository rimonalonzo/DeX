Model - MS:
Use the following services:
1. Authentication and authorization.
2. User details (I assume the user that authenticates to the system - a bank worker)
3. Check for money laundering(The main service that's running the ) 
4. Search.
5. ID Validation - using an external service.
6. Income.
7. Work history.  
8. Application Metrics.

Model - DB:
ImplementUse CQRS + Event sourcing patterns,  When the Income and Work history services write events for example to a topic in Kafka, and then the events will update a read only databases for the Search and Check for money laundering services. 


Model - Observability:
Implement Log Aggragation pattern to collect data from all the services,
using a big data platform like Splunk Or ElasticSearch to store the data. 

Also implement Distributed Tracing pattern that will include using a unique external request id that will be passed 
to all involved services and will be recorded with additional information like start time and end time.

Also implement Application Metrics and Health Check patterns to gather statistics,
when the services will push(For example using Kafka) to the Metrics service.
the data will also be used for Health Check.
 

Model - integration:
Use API Gateway to Expose the API to clients
(Optional - use it also for inter-communication between the services themselves, and using 3rd party API's
like the ID Validation)

Use a messaging platform like Kafka for getting updates about User details, Work history and Income.
